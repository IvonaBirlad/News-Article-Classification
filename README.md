# News-Article-Classification

The given dataset is a corpus made of news articles. This is a collection of approximately 140.000 articles from 15 different sources, published between the years 2000 and 2017. The data originates from Andrew’s Thompson’s publication on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news. 

After cleaning and processing the news articles, I use an LDA model to extract topics from the articles accross the years. I then proceed to build a classifier that matches the articles to the corresponsing publication.
